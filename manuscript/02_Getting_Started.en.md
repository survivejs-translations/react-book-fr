-# Getting Started

React, despite being a young library, has had a significant impact on the front-end development community. It introduced concepts, such as the virtual DOM, and made the community understand the power of components. Its component oriented design approach works well for the web. But React isn't limited to the web. You can use it to develop mobile and even terminal user interfaces.

In this part, we will start digging into React and implement a small Notes application. That is something that will eventually become a Kanban. You will learn the basics of React and get used to working with it.
