# Writing Conventions

* *filename*
* `code`

## npm

* *npm* should be in lowercase even if it's in the beginning of a sentence.

Use

```bash
npm i alt --save
```

always when installing something through *npm*. Remember to include `--save` or `--save-dev`!

## Code Examples

* Delete first, insert then.
