-# Implementing Kanban

In this part, we will turn our Notes application into a Kanban application. During the process, you will learn the basics of React. As React is just a view library we will also discuss supporting technology. We will set up a state management solution to our application. We will also see how to use React DnD to add drag and drop functionality to the Kanban board.
